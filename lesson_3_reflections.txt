When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When colaborating with several users, or needing access to my files in several machines. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Considering github is used as a platform for collaboration, every time a collaborator would push their commits, you would need to pull, creating merge conflicts, or other problems.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Fork is simply a clone within the github platform. It is used when I wish to work in someone else’s repository without disturbing their work, or when I don’t have permission to work directly on the original repository. A clone is used to create a copy of a repository, be it from a remote or local source. A branch is simply a new logical line of commits, that is usually used when implementing new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- Possibility of doing changes in the same version that all collaborators have access to, easiness in solving merge conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using dropbox. Working on small changes and monitoring the development of the project would be much harder, but dropbox does have a more intuitive interface.
